## User Story

**Tory:**<br>
Tory is a 25 year old woman who leads a very busy lifestyle and works in marketing. When she is not at work she is catching up on her favorite shows. One night she is searching for something to watch but wow, it sure seemed like there were more shows on her agenda last fall. Try as she might she could not rember all the shows she was keeping up with last year. She wishes there was an app that had a list of the shows she was keeping up with last year in addition to the dates and times they would air again. Heck, lets get crazy, wouldn't it be great if it alerted her phone the week the show was coming back on?
